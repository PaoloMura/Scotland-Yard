# Scotland-Yard
Implementation of the Scotland Yard boardgame using OOP in Java for first year coursework.

Skeleton code was provided for the UI. Our task was to use paired programming in teams of two to complete the src/main/java/uk/ac/bris/cs/scotlandyard/model package. We successfully passed all unit tests for the model part of the coursework. The majority of the task involved finding the available moves for a player and advancing the game state.
